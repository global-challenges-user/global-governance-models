# 18. Errol E. Harris: _One world or none. Prescription for survival_


# **Background and content**

**Errol E. Harris **(1908-2009) was a Professor of Philosophy at, among other places, Yale in Connecticut and Northwestern University in Illinois, USA, but he was born, grew up and was educated in South Africa. He was also a committed world federalist, Vice Chairman of the World Constitution and Parliament Association (WCPA), and after retiring, he wrote a number of books on how old-fashioned thinking on political organisation was an obstacle to constructive solutions to problems of war, environmental destruction and climate change.

The WCPA's primary contribution was to produce a proposal for a constitution for a possible world federation, which it published in 1977. The process was started in 1958 with a call and petition for a constitutional world convention at which representatives of national governments as well as the world's population together would draw up a constitution for a global state. After a number of preparatory conferences, a commission was appointed that wrote a draft constitution that was then circulated and edited and finally adopted at a meeting in Innsbruck in 1977. The WCPA's work has since been aimed at running a campaign to ratify the constitutional proposal.

In his book _One world or none. Prescription for survival_, Harries argues for the need for a federal world government and explains and develops the thoughts behind the proposed constitution. The whole constitution is available on the organisation's homepage, as well as in an appendix to Harris's book.

At the centre for Harris is the need for binding global law. What we call international law today is, according to him, in fact not law in its true sense, as to be valid laws must be possible to enforce. According to Harris, the problem is that the subjects of international law are sovereign states and that it thereby invalidates itself as, by definition, sovereignty means that there cannot be any higher binding law and because there are no effective means of enforcing laws against states that do not comply voluntarily.

According to Harris, real global law must be applied directly to individuals and there must therefore be legal institutions with authority to act in all countries' territories without being dependent on permission from the countries' governments.

The WCPA's proposed constitution describes a federal, democratic – and demilitarised – world state with responsibility for preventing war, solving conflicts, ensuring military disarmament, protecting human rights and the environment, and creating conditions for social development.

It is an important point that the federation should be non-military, but Harris emphasises that some military force may nonetheless be needed, partly to defend the federation in the initial phases before all countries have ratified the constitution, become members and disarmed their national forces, and partly to be able to defeat any potential uprisings in later stages.

_Membership _

According to the constitution, membership of Federation Earth should include all nations and all people. At the same time, it establishes that membership should be voluntarily, at least when it comes to joining. A nation becomes a member by ratifying the constitution, first in the national legislative assembly and then in a general election. Whether it should be possible for a country to exit once it has joined is unclear, but there is no exit clause and the arguments on how any uprisings could be put down suggest that an exit would not be possible.

There is a degree of discord between the requirement for voluntariness and universal membership. It is one thing that membership should be open to every nation that wants to join, but the proposal assumes that every nation does in fact become a member. This is a prerequisite for, among other things, the federation being completely demilitarised. 

There is also a clause that states that if a government refuses to hold a referendum on ratification, the federation can arrange such a referendum, either in the whole country or in some region. It is unclear, however, how this would be done in practice and also what would happen if the people voted for it but the country's government refused to ratify it. 

_Tasks and powers_

Article 1 of the constitution lays down the federation's overall tasks: 



*   to prevent war, solve conflicts and ensure military disarmament
*   to defend human rights
*   to provide all the people on earth with conditions for economic and social development and reduce the economic divides
*   to regulate world trade, means of communication, currency and other global and international processes
*   to protect the environment
*   to draw up and implement solutions to all problems that are beyond the capacity of national governments or which are or could become global international concerns

Article 4 specifies a number of tasks and powers delegated to the world government. These include: 



*   to prevent war, monitor disarmament and supply means for peaceful conflict resolution
*   to legislate global laws
*   to create common standards for weights and measurements
*   to define global standards work for improvements in working conditions, health, housing conditions, education, etc. 
*   to regulate the postal service and communications
*   to decide on and raise taxes to finance the world government's activities
*   to establish and run international airlines, railways and shipping lines, as well as means for interplanetary travel 
*   to control nuclear facilities as well as the production of fossil fuels with the aim of minimising harmful effects
*   to organise a global university system
*   to organise a voluntary and non-military force, World Service Corps, that can be used to implement different projects that benefit humanity

The constitution maintains that the world government should also remedy biased communication material that leads to misinterpretation or conflicts on the basis of differences in race, religion, gender, national origin or belonging.

The delimitation of the federation's power against member states is stated briefly in three lines: powers that are not delegated to the world government in this world constitution shall be reserved for the nations in Federation Earth and the earth's population.

_Administrative districts and regions_

In terms of administration, the federation should be structured in a number (maximum 1000) of districts that would, in principle, have as many inhabitants. The districts in turn would be divided into 20 regions, which in turn would be divided into 10 so-called Magna regions, and at least 5 continental 'divisions'. The division into districts and regions should consider geographic, cultural, ecological and other relevant factors.

The districts would serve as election districts, and the regions would form the basis partly for the organisation of authorities and partly for allocating positions in the government and different authorities. The aim seems to be to guarantee equal representation for different religious and cultural groups.

_Legislative assembly_

The legislative power of the federation rests with the parliament, which is divided into three different chambers:



*   the People's Chamber, whose representatives are appointed through direct elections in the districts
*   the Nations' Chamber, whose representatives are appointed by the member nations' governments: countries with fewer than 10 million inhabitants have one representative, those with between 10 and 100 million inhabitants have two representatives and those with more than 100 million inhabitants have three representatives. 
*   the Advisers' Chamber, whose representatives are nominated by teachers and students at universities around the world and then elected by the members of both of the other chambers

The idea is that the first chamber should represent the whole world's population according to the principle of 'one person, one vote', the second chamber should represent the states and the third should represent the highest good and best interests of the whole of humanity. It is normally only the People's and the Nations' Chambers that vote on legal proposals. For a proposal to become law it requires a majority of votes in both chambers. If there is a tie on an issue in these chambers, the issue is voted on in the Advisers' Chamber. The advisers also have the right to put forward proposals that the other chambers then vote on and to present its view on an issue before the other chambers vote.

On some issues – for example removing appointed officials – a qualified majority applies.

_Executive power_

The executive power is held by a government that is appointed through voting in all three of the parliament's chambers, after nominations by the Advisers' Chamber. The government consists of a presidium of five persons, who together have the same functions as the prime minister in many national governments. These five should represent different geographic regions, and the leadership should rotate between them so that each one holds it for one year. 

In addition to these five, the government should have a further twenty to thirty ministers, elected so that all Magna regions are represented. The ministers are nominated by the presidium but appointed by the parliament through voting in all three chambers. Each individual minister is also directly responsible to the parliament.

_Courts_

A global Supreme Court, whose 20 to 60 members are nominated by the Advisers' Chamber and appointed by the parliament by voting in all three chambers, is responsible for applying the binding laws that the parliament institutes. The appointed judges then choose from among themselves a presidium consisting of one chief judge and four assistant chief judges, chosen so that all the continental divisions are represented. 

The Supreme Court is divided into 'benches' with different main functions – criminal cases, civil cases, human rights, constitutional issues, etc. The judges for the different benches are appointed by the presidium.

_Compulsory power_

A fundamental principle is that the law would be applied directly to individuals, not to states. Thereby, the proposal is based on only one federal police force being required that can operate in all territories. No military force would be required, as all member states should have disarmed their military forces.

In addition, a federal office of the public prosecutor is part of the law enforcement authority. This is led by a chief judge and four assistant chief judges appointed by the parliament's three chambers after nomination by the Advisers' Chamber. Like the presidium in the Supreme Court, these five should represent all the continental divisions.

For every region, a regional chief judge is appointed, nominated by the world chief judge and appointed by the parliament.

The world police constitute a formal division under the world office of the public prosecution. In every region, the police are led by a regional world police chief, and there is also a world police chief who is responsible for cross-border operations and leads operations that require coordination between the police in several regions. The world police should only have enough weapons to be able to catch individual criminals.

_World ombudsman _

To protect the world's population from abuse of power and aggression from the world government, an Ombudsman's Office would be created with a chief ombudsman and four assisting ombudsmen appointed by the parliament after nomination by the Advisers' Chamber, in the same way as judges and other senior officials. The ombudsman should monitor the governments' and the different authorities' work so that no injustices and violations of individuals' rights are committed. Citizens should be able to turn to the Ombudsman's Office with complaints, and the world ombudsman should report to the world parliament and be able to take legal action if required. Exactly how this would work and who should ultimately decide on such disputes is not discussed.

_Other authorities _

In addition to legislative, executive and judicial power, the proposal drafts a World Administration with 28 different authorities, including:



*   disarmament and prevention of war 
*   population 
*   agriculture and food
*   health
*   education
*   environment
*   science and technology
*   distributive justice
*   human rights
*   democratic procedures
*   finance

_Civil rights _

The constitution also includes a list of civil rights that the world government should protect for all individuals and that the government does not have a right to ignore. These rights are in the main the usual ones: freedom from discrimination, equality before the law, freedom of expression and the press and so on.

_Taxation_

The federal world government should have the right to make decisions on and collect taxes to finance its activity.

_Implementation_

The proposal talks about three operational phases in the implementation, with the last phase, which involves total disarmament, coming into force once the constitution has been ratified by at least 80 per cent of the world's countries or at least 90 per cent of the world's population.
