# 12. Grenville Clark and Louis B. Sohn: _World peace through world law_


# **Background and content**

**Grenville Clark **was an influential American lawyer who worked as an adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the thirties. In 1958, Clark, together with fellow lawyer and Harvard Professor **Louis B. Sohn**, published the book _World peace through world law_, which contains a detailed proposal of a constitution for a hypothetical world federation. Sohn arrived in the USA from Poland in 1939, as a leading expert in international law who worked for the UN.

They met at a conference in 1945 on how the weaknesses of the then newly formed UN could be rectified. When in 1949, Clark was commissioned to write a cohesive proposal for a revision of the UN Charter, he turned to Sohn and suggested working together, which resulted in the proposal that, after having been presented, discussed and revised in many different versions, was published by Harvard University Press in 1958 with the title _World peace through world law_.

The proposal is based on the fundamental idea that real and lasting peace requires complete disarmament of all national military forces as well as a system of binding international laws backed up by an effective legal system with international courts and international police.

This world law must have a constitutional basis that clearly limits the mandate of the world authority and is applied to all states as well and all individuals in the world.

In addition to disarmament and international rule of law, Clark and Sohn believe effective measures are required to reduce the economic divides in the world, as these lead to an unstable situation and conflicts if they are allowed to continue to exist.

The book starts out from the (then) existing UN Charter and shows how it could be revised to create an international authority that would meet the requirements. The reformed world organisation also retains the name United Nations.

In the introduction to the book, Clark stresses that this is only one possible approach and that there are practical advantages to starting out from existing institutions, but if, for whatever reason, it would prove better to create a completely new organisation that would also work – the important thing was the result and not the method to achieve it.

The aim of the proposal was for the road to real peace to be made easier with a tangible and detailed proposal for an organisation that could be decided on and discussed around the world.

_Membership and consent_

Clark and Sohn emphasise that world law must apply to all states and individuals. Thereby, all, or almost all, countries must choose to become members of the new world organisation. A few countries choosing to remain outside could, at a pinch, be accepted, but they must still be bound by the law and decisions taken by the world organisation.

Furthermore, they establish that membership must be voluntarily, at least initially. Consent would thereby be required by practically all countries – five-sixths of all states, which must include at least five-sixths of the world's population and all twelve of the world's most populous countries – for the new world organisation to be realised. Once a country had become a member, however, it could not leave or be excluded. 

_General Assembly_

According to the proposal, an important change to the UN Charter would be to reform the General Assembly into a supreme decision-making and legislative body with members appointed in general elections in the different member countries in proportion to their populations. According to the authors, the transition to popularly elected members must be gradual however. In the first stage, the representatives would be appointed to the General Assembly by the states' governments or parliaments. In the second stage, at least half of the members in every country would be appointed through general elections, and not until the third stage would all members be appointed through elections. Clark and Sohn envisage a total transition period of 24 years before the general elections would be fully implemented.

Decisions in the General Assembly are normally taken with an ordinary majority of the members present, and the assembly is competent to make decisions when a majority of the members are present. For particularly important issues, special voting rules are stipulated however: for some issues, a majority of all (i.e. not just those present) members is required, and for others a majority of three-quarters of all members and a majority of at least two-thirds of the members from the twelve biggest countries.

The seats in the General Assembly would be allocated according to the size of the countries, but not strictly proportionally. The four biggest nations are envisaged to have 30 representatives each, while the 3 smallest would have 1 representative each and the remaining 92 independent nations at that time between 2 and 15. The total number of representatives would be 551.

In a comment, Clark and Sohn write that they grappled with the problem of representation for several years and examined different models, and they finally decided that this model was a reasonable compromise between consideration for the different sizes of countries and their positions as independent states. The authors prefer a system with only one chamber, as they feel that decision-making in such a system is easier and more effective than a two chamber system, and they reject different kinds of double voting procedures – which require a majority by both members and countries for a proposal to go through.

Other factors, such as economic resources and level of education, were considered as a basis for mandate allocation but, according to the authors, were rejected on the grounds that they created unnecessary complications without contributing to making the system fairer. 

_The Executive Council_

The current Security Council would be abolished and replaced by an Executive Council with 17 members appointed by the General Assembly. The members would be appointed based on a system that would guarantee a certain allocation of members between the states: the four biggest states would always have one representative each, and the next eight would share four mandates in turn, of which two would always be from Europe and two from countries outside Europe.

According to the proposal, the Executive Council would also have special voting rules, including a requirement of at least 12 out of 17 votes on particularly important issues, and these 12 votes must also include a certain number of the representatives from the biggest countries. 

The Executive Council would be answerable to and could be dismissed by the General Assembly and would function as a kind of government. Unlike many national systems in which the parliament appoints a prime minister who then appoints his or her government, every member would be appointed by the Executive Council of the General Assembly.

_Secretariat_

Like the current UN, Clark and Sohn believe that a Secretary General, appointed by the General Assembly, is needed as well as a secretariat that can support the decision-making bodies and implement decisions in practice. The Secretary General is the world organisation's highest official. 

_Courts_

One international supreme court, formed by reorganising and strengthening the powers of the current International Court of Justice, would be responsible for applying the binding laws that the General Assembly legislated. The court would have 15 members appointed for life. Under the International Court, a system of between 20 and 40 regional courts would be instituted that would judge people who had violated the international laws. The judges of these courts would be appointed by the Executive Council, and their judgements could be appealed against in the International Court, which would then have the function of a supreme court.

Clark and Sohn also propose a kind of complementary court, a World Mediation Court, whose task would be to mediate and resolve disputes of a more political than legal nature. They propose that the World Mediation Court also consists of 15 members appointed for life by the General Assembly.

The World Mediation Court's decisions, unlike those of the International Court, would not normally be binding, however, only recommendations. Only if the General Assembly voted on a decision with a three-quarter majority would the sentence become binding.

In addition, Clark and Sohn proposed instituting a World Mediation Bureau at a lower level that states could use to help them solve simple disputes.

_Armed world police_

To implement the world authority's decisions and guarantee the security of all member states in place of national defence, Clark and Sohn propose setting up a relatively powerful and well-armed world police force. This force would consist of between 200,000 and 600,000 professional soldiers – this number would be determined by the General Assembly.

To counteract dominance by strong states, the proposal stipulates that the force, in the main, be recruited from small nations and with no nation having more than three per cent of the total number of soldiers. A mixed composition is also aimed for down to unit level – with no unit having more than 50. 

In addition to this, there would be a reserve force of between 600,000 and 1,200,000 persons, recruited according to the same principles as the regular force.

The world police would have access to the most modern weapons, but no weapons of mass destruction. There would be a complete ban on chemical and biological weapons, while nuclear weapons held in reserve would be placed under the control of a special authority and not be part of the world police's arsenal and only be used after a special decision in the General Assembly, and then only if someone else had used or threatened to use nuclear weapons that they had produced in secret or hidden away.

According to the proposal, the world police should be led by a staff of five person appointed by the Executive Council, and all should come from small nations. 

_Other authorities_

As well as legislative, executive and judicial bodies, a world police force and a permanent secretariat led by the Secretary General, Clark and Sohn envisage the reformed and strengthened UN having a number of specialist bodies for different subject fields:

- An Economic and Social Council with the task of investigating and presenting proposals for measures that could promote economic and social development. The council should have 24 members elected by the General Assembly from its members. Of the members, 12 should come from the 12 countries with the highest GNP, though the countries themselves would not appoint their representatives: the General Assembly would.

- An authority called the World Development Authority under the leadership of the World Development Commission that is appointed and controlled by the Economic and Social Council. The main task of the authority would be to combat poverty and provide help with economic and social conditions that threatened peace. Clark and Sohn envisage that a considerable share of the UN's budget would be used for this purpose.

- An Administrative Council with the task of administering former colonies and other non-independent areas, with the aim of promoting economic and social progress, and developing political institutions.

- An inspection body to monitor the carrying out of total disarmament in all states. Like the world police, Clark and Sohn envisage this body being led by a staff of five persons, which must all come from small states.

- A nuclear authority with the task of controlling elements that can be used to produce nuclear weapons, promote peaceful use of nuclear power, and store and control the nuclear weapons that the UN chooses to keep, and, if there is a need, to produce new ones, and at the request of the General Assembly to equip the UN's military forces with these weapons.

- A space agency

- A number of the specialist bodies that already exist in the UN, such as UNESCO, FAO, etc. and other such bodies that the General Assembly considered necessary to carry out its assignment.

_Taxation_

To finance this revised and strengthened UN activity, the General Assembly would be given the right to decide on the budget and taxes and, in cooperation with the member nations, collect the taxes decided on. The budget may not exceed two per cent of the world's total GNP however.

Taxes should be collected from the member states' people based on ability to pay. There would be a special UN tax office in every country, and member states would be instructed to cooperate with this to collect taxes from their inhabitants. The cost of administration would be borne by the member states.

_Disarmament_

One of the fundamentals of the proposal is general and complete disarmament of all national military forces. Only pure police forces could remain under national control to the extent and with the arms decided on for every country by the Executive Council.

Clark and Sohn provide a detailed plan on how such disarmament could work. The idea is that it must be done gradually and at the same pace in all countries. There must also be reliable control mechanisms and it should be done in parallel with building up a common global military capacity that could take over responsibility for security in a credible way from the national governments. Otherwise, the authors reason, no country would dare to disarm.

The disarmament plan covers twelve years, of which the first two constitute a preparation phase when the required new institutions in the UN are built up, including a special inspection body to monitor that the countries comply with their undertakings of actual disarmament. During these preparatory years, an inventory would also be made of the levels of the countries' armaments as a basis for determining the pace of disarmament in each country.

During the ten-year actual disarmament phase, every country should reduce its military force by ten per cent per year (it is assumed that the authors mean ten per cent of the original force) proportionally across all weapon branches. Every country must draw up detailed annual disarmament plans for approval by the UN's inspection body, which would then monitor that the plans were adhered to.

If any country did not comply with the disarmament plan, the inspection body would report this to the Executive Council, which would decide on sanctions.

The inspection body should have access to all facilities and the right to make use of all means of communication necessary to carry out its assignment.

_Limitation of powers_

The revised UN in Clark and Sohn's proposal has considerably greater powers and power resources at its disposal than the current UN. The authors are careful to point out, however, that the world organisation's powers must be clearly limited to such areas that are absolutely necessary to preserve peace. Other areas must remain under the states' control, and this must be guaranteed by the constitution – otherwise, they argue, no state would accept the transfer of power that the proposal entails.

In the same way, individuals must be protected against any abuse of power. The creation of a world organisation with huge power resources at its disposal is a risk, and constitutional limitations are therefore required to reduce the risk of any abuse of power.

An essential element of this proposal is therefore a catalogue of human rights that establishes which individual rights may not be breached and which issues remain the states' own affairs in which the UN is not permitted to become involved.

In the Declaration of Human Rights, the first article establishes that all nations reserve all powers not expressly delegated to the UN in the Constitution, and in its second article that the UN may not make any decisions that restrict individual freedoms such as freedom of religion, opinion, the press, etc.

The constitutional guarantees are fairly general. According to Clark and Sohn, the International Court of Justice has an important role in defining and interpreting them by judging disputes and thereby establishing the boundaries of the UN's mandate, in roughly the same ways as the American Supreme Court on whether laws are consistent with the Constitution. 

The fact that all powers are limited in the Constitution does not mean that they are cast in stone forever but that there is an inbuilt slowness in them, as decisions on changes to the Charter requires a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly and ratification by four-fifths of all member states, of which eight must be from the twelve biggest nations.
