# 24. George Monbiot: The Age of Consent


## **Background and content**

**George Monbiot** is a British writer and political activist, active in the environmental movement and the global justice movement. He has written a number of books about the threat of climate change and global distribution of power and resources. Politically he is pretty far to the left and a known critic of the capitalist system.  In the book _The age of consent_ (in Swedish: _Samtyckets tids√•lder_)_ _however; he criticizes the elements in the global justice movement who advocates for Marxism or anarchism as an alternative to the present system, and commits himself to a democratic governance. 

In the book he argues for the need for a democratic decision-making process on a global level. In the beginning he writes that everything else has been globalized:

Democracy is the only thing relegated to the national level!

He specifically suggests four things:



1.  a democratically elected world parliament;
1.  a democratised UN General Assembly;
1.  an international clearing union that automatically compensates trade deficits and prevents indebtedness
1.  an international organization for fair trade

With regards to the first proposal: a democratic world parliament, Monbiot envisions that this must be established outside the auspices of the UN, by the citizens of the world themselves, without help or approval of any nation. The process is initiated through a series of open global meetings where the delegates are not elected. During these meetings a campaign is developed to gain support for a world parliament. The meetings will also designate an election commission, tasked with outlining electoral districts and prepare guidelines for the first election. These guidelines will then be sent for referral around the world. 

Monbiot is careful to specify that this phase can't be considered democratic, and that decisions made during this phase must be subject to repeal or change once a democratically elected parliament is in place.  He further suggests a referendum regarding the parliament directly after the first election, to ensure that it is supported by a majority of the world's population.

Monbiot briefly discusses different proposals regarding representation and voting rules, but rejects most of them as too complicated and he advocates for the simplest form - one vote per adult human being in the world.  The parliament is intended to consist of 600 delegates, who are elected according to majority rule in single member constituencies, i.e. in accordance with the British electoral system. 

The world parliament will not - at least at the initial stage - have any real power, according to Monbiot. Its influence is completely based on the moral authority that is derived by being considered the only legitimate representative of the world's citizens. This moral authority will make it difficult for powerful international institutions, such as the World Bank, to disregard its recommendations.

Monbiot estimates the cost of holding a global election to amount to approximately 5 billion USD and the operating cost to be about 300 Million USD. He discusses the problem of financing this, which is complicated by the ineligibility of states, corporations or international institutions - with the possible exception of some benevolent UN agency - to act as financiers. Any suggestions for how to accomplish this are not provided.

Another problem that he discusses is how to hold elections in states, especially in dictatorships, that are opposed to a world parliament.  He argues that there are various possibilities, such as covert elections, or having citizens who have fled their country vote on behalf of their constituencies. This he argues, will also function as a tool to democratize these countries.

Monbiot is of the opinion that democracy demands that we don't pre-determine the duties and functions of the world parliament, or impose any limits on its evolution. The parliament must be able to determine its own evolution, it is the only acceptable democratic way. Maybe it will remain an assembly with advisory functions, maybe it will choose to eventually, when it is politically feasible, to develop into a real legislative authority. Maybe it will choose to establish a democratic world government. We must, according to Monbiot, be open to this, but it is not something his proposal seriously advocates for, or even takes a position on.

Monbiot also discusses the risk of corruption and that the parliamentary delegates are controlled by other interests than those of the voters. He includes in this the risk that individual delegates are controlled by the party line when they decide proposals in the parliament. He points to the lobbying activity that is financed by capital intensive interest groups in national parliaments, as in the EU Parliament, and argues that this usurps democracy, but is impossible to completely outlaw without interfering with legitimate influences from the voters. He suggests a number of measures, such as strict anti-corruption regulation, and that the International Criminal Court, ICC, is appointed to prosecute these cases (it is however unclear who would enact these laws and commission the ICC with this responsibility, considering the parliament lacks legislative authority), but he further argues that protection against abuse of power rests foremost on transparency and independent review by media and democracy movements. 

In addition to the World Parliament, Monbiot also suggests democratization of the UN General Assembly and closing the UN Security Council. By democratization he means that every state's vote should be weighted according to size of population and rating on some form of objective global democracy index. This he means, would also give non-democratic states a strong incentive to democratize. The reformed General Assembly should, according to the proposal, assume the current duties of the Security Council. 

The issue is however, how such a reform could be executed within the framework of the current UN system, where repeal of the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council requires all five permanent members to vote in favour of it. Monbiot is aware of the problem but discusses the possibility that the Security Council will break up due primarily to the US decision to go to war without its approval, for example the invasion of Iraq. Outside of this expectation he doesn't provide any suggestions for how to solve the problem.

The idea of an international clearing union comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes, who proposed it at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 when the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were created. The clearing union aims to maintain a balance in international trade, to avoid that some countries end up in an unsustainable debt crisis. Basically the idea consists of creating a global bank, with its own currency, called _bancor_, which has a fixed exchange rate against national currencies.  Every country has an account in this bank, with assets and liabilities in bancor, equivalent to its trade surplus or trade deficit. A surplus in bancor could be used for trade, and since both countries with surpluses as well as countries with deficits at the end of the year must pay interest, an incentive to even out trade imbalances between countries, is created. 

The interest should, according to the proposal, be collected in a fund that can finance both world parliament elections and operations, as well as various projects to reduce inequalities in the world. The questions is however; how countries could be made to pay interest to such a union, and how countries that today have large trade surpluses can be compelled to voluntarily accept such an organization, not the least considering the proposal was rejected in 1944.

Monbiot's answer is that poor and indebted countries can use their debts as leverage to force a change - they can threaten to collectively cancel their payments. At issue is however how credible this is as a weapon. Even if poor and indebted countries can hurt the wealthy creditors by not repaying their debts, it is likely that the wealthy countries can hurt the poor countries even more. 

Finally Monbiot proposes a global organization to monitor fair trade. One thought is to licence companies who want to trade internationally, and impose certain requirements regarding compliance with fairness principles. The monitoring can be assigned to specific auditing companies, and the trading companies will absorb the costs. Part of the monitoring would include checking that corporations pay a reasonable price for damages to natural resources during production. 

How to establish such an institution, what resources it should have at its disposal, and how it would be able to monitor all international trade in every country and ensure that companies who lack a licence aren't able to do business, is not explained. It assumes that all of the institution's monitors can operate in all national territories and across all borders, and that all countries allow extensive regulation by an external authority within their territory. It also seems to require fairly significant resources. Who would establish such an institution, whether all states would be required to go along with it, how decisions regarding what constitutes equitable conditions are made, and whether the decisions are binding for countries who haven't voted for such an organization etc., remains unclear.
